# RC-car-controller---transmitter-and-receiver
This is to create a RC controller using the Arduino Nano, and also the NRF24L01 2.4GHz antenna.  Both the schematics for the transmitter and the receiver are in this repository.  I used a cheap car purchased at a dollar store, and it is set up to use a small servo motor.
